# HexadecimalEditor

This project implements a Hexadecimal Editor on a VGA display using the PYNQ-Z2 FPGA, developed in Verilog and designed using Xilinx Vivado. The system follows a Finite State Machine (FSM) architecture to efficiently manage user interactions, character input, and display rendering. The VGA controller operates at a resolution of 640x480, generating synchronization signals while dynamically displaying hexadecimal values input by the user. The FPGA acts as a keyboard interface, allowing users to write, edit, and navigate through the displayed text while maintaining cursor control. The editor also integrates memory management functionality, enabling reading and writing stored hexadecimal values to facilitate user modifications.

One of the key aspects of this project is the additional logic implemented beyond the standard VGA controller. A blinking cursor was designed to provide a clear visual indicator of the active input position, enhancing user interaction. The system also supports line breaks and text navigation, allowing the cursor to automatically move to the beginning of the next line when the current one is full. Additionally, color customization was incorporated, enabling dynamic changes in text color based on user input. These enhancements significantly improve usability, making the hexadecimal editor not only functional but also intuitive and interactive. The combination of custom input handling, real-time VGA rendering, and FSM-based control logic makes this project a robust and efficient solution for displaying and modifying hexadecimal values on an FPGA-driven VGA display.
